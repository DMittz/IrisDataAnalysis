<b>General Description:</b> <br>

<i>Introductory Projects: </i> <br>
Iris Data Analysis:<br>
&emsp; ML Analysis of a the Iris Flowers' Data Set <br>
Customer Segmentation:<br>
&emsp; ML Model made trained to predict outcomes by comparing input data to clustered data points that have been assigned to seperate groups <br>
Diabetes Dataset:<br>
&emsp; ML Model that uses Decision Tree Classifier to make predictions and understand the given data <br>

<b>Spam Detector:</b><br>
&emsp; ML Model that has been trained through Naive Bayes Neural Network to analyse 5000+ emails used as training data, until the neurons are sufficiently trained to independently predict & classify new incoming emails as 'spam' or 'not spam'.
